## Get familiar with the LIDAR
A Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging)is a remote sensing technique that allows finding the distance of an object or a surface using a laser impulse and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver.

For this activity I will use [Slamtec RP A1](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A1). It is a cheap but performant device that can be easily coneected to a Raspberry Pi using either the GPIO or the USB port. You can buy it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Slamtec-RPLIDAR-Scanning-Avoidance-Navigation/dp/B07TJW5SXF) for less rhan $100.

I have written a vanilla javascript wrapper around
